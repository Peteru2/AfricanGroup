                    Trust & Integrity comes first for me when doing business! At
                    first, I was a bit skeptical about doing business with
                    African Group when I met their director years back, but I'm
                    glad I trusted my instincts. It turned out great. I have
                    gladly recommended them to many clients and was not let
                    down. Keep it up, African Group!
